# FeedBack

One of the feedback I got from play testers was that the map starting room was ubstructing the doors to the next room because of the pillar I had. So what I did I moved the pillars to the side instead of the middle so its easier for the player to see the door.

I trieed to give it more of a gothic medieval architecture when building this, which is why I used this texture. It gave it a grainy feel once you ntoice that you have rusty buckets and wooden beds in the cell.

# Lighting 

I started adding lighting to part of my maps and I would like to show the process of that.

Here I have a sketch of what I wanted this part of my map to look and what type of cover and props that I would like in it. For example the stone stove and the table and the pillars, I have images of the refreance's of midevil kitchens

# Sketch to engine 

After knowing what I wanted layout wise and what type of feel I wanted to to give the player. I started blocking the map and adding textures and then adding more and more detail to the map like pots and pans and cups.
