When comming up with a theme for my map I thought of a sky castle feeling. Which is my reasoning for my use of these wads here ⬆️

You might ask, what is a sky castle? Well imagine a pillar made out of mountain with a flat surface and a small midevil castle on top of it.
With clouds covering the area, thats how you know we are in a "Sky castle" 

I want the player to feel like their in a magical place but not in a eutopia because even fairy tails have a good and a bad, and your the hero of this place.
